I was mate on hoard the barque <i>Jane</i>,
 which laid off a port of Mexico, in May lastâ€”she was an English 
vessel, and had sailed from Liverpoolâ€”the prisoners both belonged to 
the shipâ€”one of the seamen gave me information in May last, in 
consequence of which I looked about and missed a boat, and four men of 
the vessel were goneâ€”the prisoners are two of themâ€”I also missed 
some oars, a top-gal-lant studding sail, a cask, my own watch, and some 
clothes belonging to two seamenâ€”I had been on deck myself till eleven 
o'clock the night before, and left the prisoner Thomas on deck in charge
 of the watchâ€”the other prisoner was belowâ€”the master of the vessel 
had been on shore some daysâ€”the captain made a communication to the 
English consul of what had occurredâ€”I am sure the prisoners are two of
 the men.</p>               <p>                  <i>Thomas. Q.</i> You gave the watch in my charge when you went below? <i>A.</i> Yes, I was in the habit of doing itâ€”it was a small silver watch.</p>               <p>                  <span style="font-size: 80%;">COURT</span>. <i>Q.</i> Who had charge of the vessel in your absence? <i>A.</i> He had during the two hours of his watchâ€”I have seen it safe sinceâ€”(<i>produced</i>) â€”this is it.</p>               <p>                  <i>M'Clive</i>. We did not steal any clothing from the vessel, it is a mistake. <i>Witness</i>. Two of the men complained of losing their clothes.</p>               <p>                  <span style="font-size: 80%;">                                                                                             JOHN BUURMESTER                  </span>. I was a seaman on board the barque <i>Jane</i>â€”I
 remember when she laid off the portâ€”I was on deck about nine 
o'clockâ€”Thomas came up to me and said, "You are a dead man"â€”in 
consequence of that I went belowâ€”I went up on deck again about three 
o'clock in the morningâ€”four men were then gone from the vesselâ€”the 
prisoners are two of themâ€”the boat and sails, cask and other things 
were gone from the vessel, which were on board when I went belowâ€”the 
boat was on board, lying aft, when Thomas said, "You are a dead man"â€”I
 missed a jacket, waistcoat, two pairs of trowsers, and four shirts, of 
my own.</p>               <p>                  <i>Thomas. Q.</i> Did you see me take anything belonging to the ship? <i>A.</i> Noâ€”it was not Jackson that told me if I did not go down I should be a dead man.</p>               <p>                  <i>M'Clive. Q.</i> You did not see me take any of your clothes? <i>A.</i> Noâ€”Jackson was one of the four men that went.</p>               <p>                  <span style="font-size: 80%;">                                                                                             JOHN TEMPERLEY                  </span>. I was master of the barque <i>Jane</i>, and am part owner of her with othersâ€”the value of my property taken from the vessel is about 40<i>l</i>.â€”the
 boat was worth nineteen guineasâ€”I have not recovered any part of 
itâ€”I was on shore at the timeâ€”the vessel was sixteen miles</p>                              <p>from
 shore, on the high seasâ€”in consequence of a communication from the 
Admiralty, I went to Cork, and found the two prisoners in custodyâ€”I 
saw this watch thereâ€”it was given to Roe by the Cork constable.</p>               <p>                  <span style="font-size: 80%;">                                                                                             JOHN ROE                  </span>. I am an officer. The watch was handed to me by the Cork officer at Guildhallâ€”I was not at Corkâ€”the officer is not here.</p>               <p>                  <i>Thomas's Defence</i>.
 I was taken from the ship into the boat in consequence of being in 
liquor; the apprentice had given me liquor, and I did not know where I 
was till next day; I laid in the bottom of the boat all night, till next
 day, when I told Jackson I wished to be put on board my ship again; he 
said it was impossible; I was landed on the Spanish main, and when I got
 back, the ship was gone; I delivered myself up to the Spanish Consul, 
and said I had the mate's watch, and delivered it up. I knew nothing of 
its being taken from the ship till next day.</p>               <p>                  <span style="font-size: 80%;">                                                                                             JOHN TEMPERLEY                  </span>                   <i>re-examined</i>.
 I first heard of them about the 18th of Mayâ€”the boat was taken 
between the 11th and 16thâ€”I heard nothing of them till they got to 
Cork, but they were arrested by the Consulâ€”Jackson was also arrested, 
and broke out of prison.</p>               <p>                  <i>Q.</i> Was there any allowance on board to make him intoxicated? <i>A.</i> The only complaint in the ship was for the want of that allowanceâ€”I do not know how the prisoners were taken.</p>               <p>                  <span style="font-size: 80%;">                                                                                             SAMUEL JEFFERSON                  </span>                   <i>re-examined</i>.
 Thomas was perfectly sober at eleven o'clock at night, and there was no
 means of his getting any thing after-wardsâ€”Jackson was not so 
powerful a man as Thomasâ€”he had been sick with ague.</p>               <p>                  <i>Thomas</i>.
 I had one bottle of brandy, and one of rum given me by Williams and a 
boy on board besides, they had some gin in a bowl three parts full.</p>               <p>                  THOMASâ€”                                                GUILTY                  .
